# Metadata Screenshots

This folder contains placeholder screenshots for the GLB Transform extension.

## Required Screenshots

According to Raycast extension guidelines, extensions with view commands require screenshots in the metadata folder.

### Screenshots Needed:

1. **glb-advanced-1.png** - Screenshot of the Advanced GLB Transform form interface
2. **glb-advanced-2.png** - Screenshot showing the Advanced GLB Transform in action or results
3. **glb-inspect-1.png** - Screenshot of the Inspect GLB File detail view
4. **glb-inspect-2.png** - Screenshot showing GLB inspection results/analysis

### Guidelines:

- Screenshots should be actual captures of the extension in use
- Recommended dimensions: 640x480 or similar (16:9 or 4:3 aspect ratio)
- Show the extension's UI and features clearly
- Include example workflows where applicable

**Note:** The current PNG files are minimal placeholders and should be replaced with actual screenshots before publishing the extension.
